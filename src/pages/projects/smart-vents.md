## Overview

__Automatic, boosted, targeted, smart ventilation system for whole home ERV__

We started our major home renovation just prior to pandemic. So my "pandemic project" ended up being much more substaintial than anticipated. I did all sorts of modern building science upgrades during the reno. One such upgrade involved adding ductwork and vents to all major rooms in the house. Although I had my HVAC company quote the installation, I took the effort on myself.

My goal was an ERV with boost capability with targeted stale air exhaust and fresh air supply. I landed on the following vents:
